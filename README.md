# hmi-probation-youth-justice-scrape  

This repository contains a **scraper for HM Inspectorate of Probation Youth Justice inspection reports**, extracting structured data from published PDFs. The extracted data is compiled into a **summary dataset**, which is automatically updated and published as an HTML report. Note: We are reviewing with colleagues atm regarding how best to potentially combine historic/mis-matched grading columns to improve the summary output usefulness and display without compromising the expected gradings. 

## ðŸš€ Features  

- Scrapes **only Youth Justice inspection reports** from HMI Probation  
- Extracts **inspection ratings and outcomes** directly from PDF reports  
- Outputs data in **structured CSV and HTML formats**  
- **Setup and execution automated** via `./setup.sh`  
- **Alpha release** â€“ still in development, feedback welcome!  

## ðŸ”§ Setup & Running
